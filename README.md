# TriforkSwiftExtensions

## Motivation
This framework is a large set of useful convenience extensions for Apple's SDKs. Most functions are kept as very small functions, which makes the SDK a little easier to use.

## Installation
### SPM
SPM is supported from version 1.3.3! 🥳

### Carthage
```
github "trifork/TriforkSwiftExtensions" ~> 1.5.1
```
